# Reagan High School Bell Schedule

You can find the website for this project at
[renaissancedog.github.io/reagan-schedule](https://renaissancedog.github.io/reagan-schedule).

I first made this as a very basic website sophomore year because I didn't want to memorize a bell schedule.
Since then, I've improved how it runs, completely overhauled the codebase, and added a feature to help students select courses.

Inspiration and a little bit of code taken from [https://tyleri.github.io/stuy-schedule](https://tyleri.github.io/stuy-schedule).
