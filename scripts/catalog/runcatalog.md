1. Copy/paste entire catalog into .txt file - I use https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-txt
2. Remove the first ~20 pages (the ones without courses)
3. Run script

The .txt files are:
- zcatalog: the copy/pasted catalog, no modifications
- rawcatalog: catalog with front pages removed
- midcatalog: generated and used in the script
- processedcatalog: located in client/static, final catalog parsed by JS
